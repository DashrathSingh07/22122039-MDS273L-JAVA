You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that can encrypt or decrypt a message that the user wishes to transfer.

Your program should have two functions, one for encryption and another for decryption. Each function will accept a string message and return the encrypted or decrypted message.



Draw a flow chart for your program and write the pseudocode before starting the coding in your observation notebook.
